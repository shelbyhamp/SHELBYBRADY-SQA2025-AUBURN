COMP 5710 Project Report

We created a Git Hook that will run every time a python file is committed; it will scan for security vulnerabilities and write a report to integration-test-results/bandit_report.csv. The script we did this with is inside hooks/pre-commit. We also did fuzzing with the hypothesis library on 5 functions with the fuzz.py script. The fuzzer will generate random input to catch any crashes or edge case failures. We fuzzed the following functions getCountFromAnalysis, runScanner, json.loads, pandas.read_csv, and df.to_csv. The failures are logged in integration-tests-results/fuzz_report.csv. This script will run on every push or pull request because we integrated it into GitHub actions workflow. We added logging with Pythonâ€™s logging module; this will keep track of usage, inputs and context all of which is written to integration-test-results/forensics_log.csv. Logging was added inside of main.py and scanner.py to getCountFromAnalysis, checkIfValidSecret, scanUserName, scanPasswords, and main. This will assist in keeping track of secrets and sensitive inputs. We built a CI pipeline in .github/workflows/forensics-integration.yml. This pipeline will check the repo and set up python, install dependencies, run the bandit scan, executes fuzz.py, and generates integration_results.csv on with a summary of the results on every commit or pull request.

Together we learned how to configure and use GitHub actions for CI, how to use bandit for static code analysis, how to write basic fuzzers, and how logging can help to trace bugs and secure data.
